 Clonezilla, based on DRBL, Partclone, and udpcast, allows you to do bare metal backup and recovery. Two types of Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE (Server Edition). Clonezilla live is suitable for single machine backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive deployment, it can clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously.

## What is this?

The original clonezilla homepage is a vital tool for many users, and while its documentation is essential, its presentation leaves a lot to be desired. The original markup was broken and injected with several scripts for unpleasant ads which, while very likely keep the website running with passive revenue, often breaks the entire experience.

This repository attempts to restructure the original markup, including its HTML, CSS and PHP documents, with a fresh perspective to improve client experience when viewed on a desktop or mobile internet browser.
